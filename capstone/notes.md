https://www.meteoscientific.com/docs/tutorial-extras/documentation - "As you progress further into your MeteoScientific & Chirpstack journey, you'll want to start integrating outside apps so you can actually use your data.

The MeteoScientific Console uses a custom implemented version of Chirpstack maintained by Paul Pinault at Disk91.

For many Chirpstack aspects of the MetSci LNS, you can find relevant vanilla Chirpstack docs here.

There are, however, more custom aspects, like how to do an HTTP integration, or manage an MQTT integration, or questions about the API. You can find answers to all of those here."

- "Helium hotspots can allow for up to 2 km. of range in urban areas to up to 15 km. in rural zones. ... The good news is that thousands of cities around the world already have Helium coverage. .... Basically, you donâ€™t need to worry about whether you will have Helium coverage, or not. Chances are you already do. "
- "According to a GSMA analysis, smart parking is more than just for convenience. A well optimized parking solution will reduce traffic volume by 8% on average and it will reduce the distance travelled in search for a parking space by 30%. People will also save 43% of time on average to find a parking spot. All of this will also reduce pollution. And parking operators can get up to $93.70 increase in monthly revenue per parking space (average price is high because in a lot of big cities parking is already an expensive service)."

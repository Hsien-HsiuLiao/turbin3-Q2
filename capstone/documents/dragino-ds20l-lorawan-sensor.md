https://www.meteoscientific.com/docs/tutorial-extras/documentation - "As you progress further into your MeteoScientific & Chirpstack journey, you'll want to start integrating outside apps so you can actually use your data.

The MeteoScientific Console uses a custom implemented version of Chirpstack maintained by Paul Pinault at Disk91.

For many Chirpstack aspects of the MetSci LNS, you can find relevant vanilla Chirpstack docs here.

There are, however, more custom aspects, like how to do an HTTP integration, or manage an MQTT integration, or questions about the API. You can find answers to all of those here."
